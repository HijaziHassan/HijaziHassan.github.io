## Hi there!

Thank you for dropping by!

## Open to Work ...!

I am seeking a project where I can apply the knowledge and skills I've gained in proteomics and programming throughout my PhD journey.

Ideally, this role would be at the intersection of wet and dry lab work, involving the acquisition, cleaning, and analysis of proteomics data in a clinical context related to human health.
